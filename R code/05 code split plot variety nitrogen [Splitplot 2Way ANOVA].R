# Split Plot Design 
# Two-Way ANOVA

### Split Plot Design 
# When some factors (independent variables) are difficult 
# or impossible to change in your experiment, a completely 
# randomized design isn't possible. The result is a 
# split-plot design, which has a mixture of hard to
# randomize (or hard-to-change) and easy-to-randomize 
# (or easy-to-change) factors. The hard-to-change factors 
# are implemented first, followed by the easier-to-change factors.

# boxplots for first impression
boxplot(data=dt, Yield ~ N + Var, las=2)
boxplot(data=dt, Yield ~ N      , las=2)
boxplot(data=dt, Yield ~ Var    , las=2)

# In a split-plot design, the (incomplete) mainplots should
# be taken as a "random effect". As a general principle, 
# each randomization units needs to be represented by a random effect, 
# so each randomization unit has its own error term. 
# Since we then have random and fixed effects
# in one model, we are fitting a "mixed model".
# In R the most common packages for that are "lme4", "nlme", "asreml-R" and "sommer".

# If you use lme4, always load the lmerTest package, too
#install.packages("lme4")
#install.packages("lmerTest")

# Treatment effects: Variety, Fertilizer and their interaction
# Design effects:    Block and mainplot(=random effect)
# Step 1: Check F-Test of ANOVA and perform backwards elimination
# Step 2: Compare adjusted means per level
